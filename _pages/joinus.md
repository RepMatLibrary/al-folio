<strong>RepMat</strong> is a collaborative distributed materials library. Different physical structures can be showcased through the virtual part of the library, creating a <strong>single database and a virtual network</strong>. The library itself can <strong>grow</strong> thanks to the <strong>contribution and collaboration</strong> of different users and local communities.

If you are replicating or creating your own physical structures and sets of samples, <strong>contact us</strong> for being added to the database of the virtual library and be included as a <strong>contributor!</strong> Fill the following form and you will be contacted as soon as possible. We will send you all the information that we need to <strong>add your work in the RepMat library</strong>. You can also contact us in case of modifications and further versions of the physical structures or replication materials to be featured in the RepMat website.
